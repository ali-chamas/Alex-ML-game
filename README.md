<!-- project philosophy -->
<img src="./readme/title2.svg"/>

> A machine learning game, where kids and even adults can learn machine learning by building testing and using their own models using NO CODE.
> At Alex, users will choose a level (Text recognition, image recognition or numbers recognition), choose a game and build an AI model based on the requirements of this game.
> After building the model, users can test it, then deploy it to scratch via Alex's extension to play with their model and finish the game! Each time a user finish a game he will unlock another.

### User Stories

- As a user:
- I'm interested in machine learning but want to learn it in a fun and challenging way.
- I don't want to learn machine learning through courses since I can't code. I want to build my model using no-code tools.
- I want to use my model in Scratch to create a character that represents my model and play with it.
- As a content creator:
- I aim to invent new game ideas and create step-by-step tutorials for solving them.
- I plan to post these games and their solutions on the website after getting admin approval.
- I want to track user progress to see if they enjoy my games

<!-- Tech stack -->
<img src="./readme/title3.svg"/>

### Alex is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the [React.js Library](https://react.dev/). React.js is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, especially single-page web applications.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) NoSQL database that uses a document-oriented data model, making it easy to store and retrieve data in a flexible JSON-like format.
- For the backend, [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) with [Express](https://expressjs.com/) is utilized, providing a robust framework for building scalable and efficient server-side logic
- For Machine Learning, [Brain.js](https://brain.js.org/) is used to allow users to create their custom text-recognition models. Brain.js is a JavaScript library for building and training neural networks, useful for tasks like data analysis and pattern recognition.
